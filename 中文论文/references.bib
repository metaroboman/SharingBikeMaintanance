 abstract={It seems necessary to detect a broken bike rooted at a station in near realtime as the number of bikes within bikeshare systems has reached more than a million in 2015. Indeed, a bike that cannot be moved is not cost effective in terms of number of trips. This brings frustration to users who were expecting to find a bike at that station without knowing that it is actually defective. We thus propose a methodology from feature extraction to anomaly detection on a distributed cloud infrastructure in order to detect bicycles requiring a repair. Through a first step of K-means clustering, and a second step consisting of spotting samples that do not clearly belong to any cluster, we separate anomalies from normal behaviors. The proposal is validated on a publicly available dataset provided by Motivate, the operator of the New-York bikeshare system. The number of distinct bikes that have been classified by this algorithm as broken at least once during a month is close to the number of repairs given in monthly reports of Motivate.},

 abstract={Free-floating bike sharing (FFBS) is an innovative bike sharing model. FFBS saves on start-up cost, in comparison to station-based bike sharing (SBBS), by avoiding construction of expensive docking stations and kiosk machines. FFBS prevents bike theft and offers significant opportunities for smart management by tracking bikes in real-time with built-in GPS. However, like SBBS, the success of FFBS depends on the efficiency of its rebalancing operations. Rebalancing refers to the reestablishment of the number of bikes at sites to desired quantities. Static rebalancing for SBBS is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. FFBS takes it a step further, with an increase in the scale of the problem. This article is the first effort in a series of studies of FFBS planning and management, tackling static rebalancing with single and multiple vehicles. We present a Novel Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation for solving the Static Rebalancing Problem in FFBS. The proposed formulation, can not only handle single as well as multiple vehicles, but also allows for multiple visits to a node by the same vehicle. We present a hybrid nested large neighborhood search with variable neighborhood descent algorithm, which is both effective and efficient in solving static rebalancing problems for both FFBS and SBBS. Computational experiments were carried out on the 1-PDTSP instances used previously in the literature and on a new set of instances based on the Share-A-Bull FFBS (SABB) program recently launched at University of South Florida on its Tampa campus. Computational experiments on the 1-PDTSP instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms a tabu search algorithm and is highly competitive with exact algorithms previously reported in the literature for solving static rebalancing problems in SBSS. Computational experiments on the SABB instances, consisting of up to 400 nodes, 300 bikes and 3 vehicles, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to deal with the increase of scale of the static rebalancing problem pertaining to FFBS while deriving high-quality solutions in a reasonable amount of CPU time.},

abstract="As a favorite urban public transport mode, the bike sharing system is a large-scale and complicated system, and there exists a key requirement that a user and a bike should be matched sufficiently in time. Such matched behavior makes analysis of the bike sharing systems more difficult and challenging. To design a better bike sharing system, it is a key to analyze and compute the probabilities of the problematic (i.e., full or empty) stations. In fact, such a computation is established for some fairly complex stochastic systems. To do this, this paper considers a more general large-scale bike sharing system from two important views: (a) Bikes move in an irreducible path graph, which is related to geographical structure of the bike sharing system; and (b) Markovian arrival processes (MAPs) are applied to describe the non-Poisson and burst behavior of bike-user (abbreviated as user) arrivals, while the burstiness demonstrates that the user arrivals are time-inhomogeneous and space-heterogeneous in practice. For such a complicated bike sharing system, this paper establishes a multiclass closed queueing network by means of some virtual ideas, for example, bikes are abstracted as virtual customers; stations and roads are regarded as virtual nodes. Thus user arrivals are related to service times at station nodes; and users riding bikes on roads are viewed as service times at road nodes. Further, to deal with this multiclass closed queueing network, we provide a detailed observation practically on physical behavior of the bike sharing system in order to establish the routing matrix, which gives a nonlinear solution to compute the relative arrival rates in terms of the product-form solution to the steady-state probabilities of joint queue lengths at the virtual nodes. Based on this, we can compute the steady-state probability of problematic stations, and also deal with other interesting performance measures of the bike sharing system. We hope that the methodology and results of this paper can be applicable in the study of more general bike sharing systems through multiclass closed queueing networks.",
